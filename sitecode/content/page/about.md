My name is Aaron Cupp. I have been on the internet for WAY too long...

I started my journey down the rabbit hole that is internet technology when I was about 11 years old.  The internet was still GOPHER and ARCHIE access via BBS systems.   I got lucky and had access to the local college internet via my mother, who was one of the SYSOPs at the college.

I am mostly self-taught when it comes to my computer education.  I learned BASIC and COBOL on my own from books.  Self taught linux from breaking systems I built in my bedroom.  My first Linux OS was Slackware...floppy install.  There was about 50 of them for the OS and X-windows :)  I got into IRC and MUDs not long after getting online.  Both of these got me more involved in programming and systems.  I picked up LPC (a C-like language for game development) from MUD gaming.  I picked up tcl from playing with eggdrop bots in IRC.

I got my official education from Modesto Junior College, earning an A.S. in Computer Science as well as a Computer Programming Certificate.

In my spare time while working for a K-12 in Northern California I was involved in running a number of irc networks and internet radio stations.  From 2007-2008 I developed the station for techno-dnb.com and in 2009 I launched my own project and operated it till about 2014 as an online radio platform.  I used these personal projects as a basis for my professional advancement and moved out of the public sector and into the private world of the Bay Area Tech Bubble.  

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had the opportunity to start working on my personal projects again.  I relaunched my Tech-Noid Systems project as a Bass Music Collective.  This project will be releasing a podcast and will start throwing shows in the future. 

Over the past few years I was given a great opportunity to grow professionally and have migrated into Technology Leadership.  My most recent role was Manager of Site Reliability Engineering.  In this role I was responsible for hiring, onboarding, mentoring and fostering growth for a geographically distributed team of 5 FTE SREs and two offshore remote teams of SRE and DevOps Engineers for a SaaS Data Analytics platform.
