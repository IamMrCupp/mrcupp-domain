### About
Born in 2008 as an irc network that was hosting some channels for various internet radio projects and electronics projects that I had been part of.  After leaving techno-dnb.com radio in 2008 I launched Tech-Noid Systems as an online Radio Platform.  The radio feeds stayed online till about 2014 when there was an issue with the hardware that took the project offline.  

Fast forward to 2021 and the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing.  I started reworking the website and decided to relaunch things as a podcast and a bass music collective.  In the future we plan on hosting more shows and eventually in-person events in Northern California.
