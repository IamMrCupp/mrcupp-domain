I recently had the need to embed an iframe into a hugo page.  this isn't an ideal thing to do since hugo uses markdown for definigin the contents of the page.  Hugo does however have a nice feature called 'shortcode'.  It's basically an html partial that can be used in markdown.

I needed to embed Soundcloud playlists into at least one page on this site.  I am also using this site as the framework to convert (tech-noid.net)[1] and (emotionalsupportpizza.com)[2] to (hugo)[3] and the (JAMStack)[4] architecture.
