## Howdy!
Welcome to my corner of the web.  This is my new site.
I have finally taken the plunge and started learning JAMStack development.

This site is using a number of technologies:
* oci-compliant containers
* gitops
* JAMStack

More information about the change to framework, etc will eventually show up in a blog post.

Menu system functional.   Expect more information over the coming days/weeks.
